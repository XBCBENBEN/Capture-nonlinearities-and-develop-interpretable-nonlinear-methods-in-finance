This repo contains all my work related to M4R project in Imperial College London.

It includes all the code used in the project and the corresponding plots generated by code. The data is not in the repo since the data cannot be made public. If you want to get the data used in the study, you can get in touch through the email address: cxy0627@yeah.net.
